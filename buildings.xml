Slope-topped light wells, and cantilevered stairs on the exterior recall the sculptural late work of LeCorbusier. The facade has been altered by a metal, bowed front that was added in 1987-8 by Research Planning Associates whose members included Maria Romanach, the daughter of the late Mario Romanach, designer of the building.</description>

		<description>Claudia Cohen Hall, opened for use by the University's Medical School in 1874, was the second building constructed by the University on its West Philadelphia campus, following by two years the construction of College Hall, located directly to its east. Thomas W. Richards who also supplied the design for College Hall designed this building. After the School of Medicine moved to the Medical Laboratories Building (now the John Morgan Building) on Hamilton Walk, the building was known as Logan Hall, in memory of James Logan, William Penn's colonial secretary and a founding trustee of the College of Philadelphia, the University's predecessor institution and it became the home of the Wharton School. After the completion of Vance Hall, the Wharton School's last programs left Logan Hall and the building became the home of several School of Arts and Sciences departments as well as University Life and other administrative offices.</description>

		<description>College Hall was the first building on the West Philadelphia campus. Designed by Thomas Webb Richards, a professor of drawing and architecture, the building housed almost all of the college functions, including the library, classrooms, laboratories and offices. In recent years, the building has been the home of the President, Provost, School of Arts and Sciences, the Department of History and the Undergraduate Admissions Office. The building's significance in the history of collegiate architecture has been recognized by U.S. Department of Interior by placing it on the National Registry of Historic Places and in the University of Pennsylvania Historic District.</description>

		<description>The unusual plan of Bennett Hall, with the main facade on the beveled corner, is dictated by its unusual site at the juncture of three streets (Walnut, 34th, and the diagonal of the former Woodland Avenue).?? Because of the slope of the site, the building goes from four to six stories.?? The principal facade is symmetrical with a central tower articulated by decorative buttresses rising to corner spires above the main entrance.?? The tower is flanked by two???story windows below a battlement at the roof line.?? The side facades are marked by regularly placed fenestration with quoined surrounds rising to large, gabled dormers.?? The second and fourth floors are articulated by limestone water tables. Originally built as Bennett College, the first facility built for women at the University;?? including classrooms, a library, a gymnasium and a student union, is an important landmark to the campus. The building was generously renovated and upgraded in 2005 and re-opened in 2006 as Fisher-Bennett Hall. Currently the English Department, English Language Programs, Music Department and Cinema Studies are the major occupants of this building.</description>

		<description>The Philadelphia architectural firm of Cope and Stewardson designed nine campus buildings between 1892 and 1912 and did much to give Penn a unified architectural presence. John Morgan has similarities to the other Cope and Stewardson campus buildings of similar function, such as Towne Building and the Leidy Labs. The conventions of the Cope and Stewardson vocabulary are continued here in the irregular quoins, which surround the windows and articulate the corners of the buildings. A parapet articulates the roofline with a limestone balustrade over the regular registers of the facade. The main (north) facade, on Hamilton Walk, is symmetrically composed, with two protruding end pavilions and a central entrance pavilion. The central pavilion is faced in limestone. It terminates in a tower of rectangular plan above the roof-line. A limestone balustrade crowns the tower with obelisks at the corners. The building is fenestrated by large, rectilinear, grouped windows. On the rear (south) of the building is a centrally placed one story octagonal space, now connected to the Anatomy/Chemistry Wing, which originally served as an operating theater. The principal interior spaces of historic interest are the central corridor, grand stair and main cross-corridor. These spaces retain the historic character of the Cope and Stewardson interior with plaster cornices and marble wainscoting, now richly hung with portraits that indicate the historic importance of the school and the building. There are the remains of the marble wainscoting and marble pilasters of the great, two-story reading room of the library in the center, beyond the main stair.</description>

		<description>Constructed as the Pennsylvania Railroad Freight Building in 1929, in a restrained Art Deco style, the first floor is sheathed in limestone with the upper stories clad in buff colored brick with limestone details. Rising six stories above a track level, the building was originally designed as a combination freight station, warehouse and showroom, and is characterized by immense massing, typical of industrial architecture. The structure was renovated and converted into condominium apartments, with a massive open courtyard carved from the interior, by the firm of Bower Lewis Thrower Architects in 2001.</description>

The screen wall around the chiller plant celebrates the industrial nature of the structure while giving it a distinct identity. By day, the corrugated perforated stainless steel screen is a shimmering, silvery object, by night, the building becomes a translucent glowing object. This major element of infrastructure is a memorable, elegant form, set in a vibrant green landscape.</description>

		<description>A team of three prominent Philadelphia architects designed the University Museum, all of who taught on the faculty of the University -- Wilson Eyre, Cope and Stewardson and Frank Miles Day and Brother. Only a portion of the original plan for the Museum was built. The first phase was completed in 1899 and housed the discoveries from an expedition sponsored by the University to the ancient site of Nippur. In 1915, the rotunda, which houses the Harrison Auditorium in the basement, was completed. Charles G. Klauder designed the Coxe Memorial Wing, which opened in 1926 to house the Museum's Egyptian collection. The Sharpe Wing was completed in 1929.</description>

		<description>During the 1960s, Penn planning looked in two directions, toward contextualism in the work of the Philadelphia School, and toward confrontation in the work of most of the architects from outside of the region. These three residential towers take the latter, more conventionally modern course, in a great vertical T-plan slab of poured-in-place concrete that seems to grow larger at the top, recalling modernism's heroic age. The buildings were designed by G. Holmes Perkins, dean of the Graduate School of Fine Arts, and Professor of Design Mario Romanach.?? This residence is named for Judith Seitz Rodin, President of the University, 1994 to 2004.</description>

		<description>Skirkanich Hall promotes enhanced connection between the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the greater Penn academic community. This new facility provides an opportunity to unite formerly disparate spaces and give the SEAS a dramatic and welcoming front door. Equally important to embracing the campus is the intimacy of the Quain courtyard between the four buildings, Levine, Towne, Skirkanich, and Moore.</description>

		<description>The Wharton School moved to Dietrich Hall from overcrowded quarters in Logan Hall. The New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead &amp;, White which designed many of Columbia University&amp;rsquo,s facilities, designed the building. By the early 1980s, growth in Wharton School programs created a strong need for additional facilities. The University asked the firm of Warner Burns, Toane and Lunde (also from New York) to prepare designs for renovating the original building and for an addition. Behind the new facade, the original Dietrich facade is largely intact on the interior and retains the limestone panel on which was inscribed Dietrich Hall. The addition sides and rear retain the detailing of the original building, which overlaid a slightly orange brick with limestone trim and organized windows into vertical bands in the fashion of contemporary design. The original building honored D. Wellington Dietrich, uncle of H. Richard Dietrich and Daniel W. Dietrich, Wharton graduates and benefactors of the University. The 1983 renovation and addition honors Saul Steinberg, CEO of the Reliance Group Holdings and University graduate, trustee and donor of the facility.</description>

		<description>The Towne Building is one of the Cope and Stewardson designs that established the architectural character of the University's large laboratory buildings such as Leidy Laboratories and the John Morgan Building. The design is styled in the manner of English classicism of the seventeenth century with clear references to the work of Christopher Wren. It is a major feature of Smith Walk and 33rd Street. When opened in 1906, it housed the machine shops and related facilities used to train students in modern industrial practice. It remains the home of the School of Engineering and Applied Science administrative offices and of several of its departments. Towne houses the SEAS Library. The building is named to honor the memory of the Philadelphia industrialist, trustee and donor, John Henry Towne.</description>
