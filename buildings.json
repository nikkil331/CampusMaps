The buildings were designed by G. Holmes Perkins, dean of the Graduate School of Fine Arts, and Professor of Design Mario Romanach.?? This residence is named for Charles Custis Harrison, Provost of the University, 1894 to 1910.",

John Morgan has similarities to the other Cope and Stewardson campus buildings of similar function, such as Towne Building and the Leidy Labs. The conventions of the Cope and Stewardson vocabulary are continued here in the irregular quoins, which surround the windows and articulate the corners of the buildings. A parapet articulates the roofline with a limestone balustrade over the regular registers of the facade. The main (north) facade, on Hamilton Walk, is symmetrically composed, with two protruding end pavilions and a central entrance pavilion. The central pavilion is faced in limestone. It terminates in a tower of rectangular plan above the roof-line. A limestone balustrade crowns the tower with obelisks at the corners. The building is fenestrated by large, rectilinear, grouped windows. On the rear (south) of the building is a centrally placed one story octagonal space, now connected to the Anatomy/Chemistry Wing, which originally served as an operating theater. The principal interior spaces of historic interest are the central corridor, grand stair and main cross-corridor. These spaces retain the historic character of the Cope and Stewardson interior with plaster cornices and marble wainscoting, now richly hung with portraits that indicate the historic importance of the school and the building. There are the remains of the marble wainscoting and marble pilasters of the great, two-story reading room of the library in the center, beyond the main stair.",

        "description": "The Wharton School moved to Dietrich Hall from overcrowded quarters in Logan Hall. The New York architectural firm of McKim, Mead &, White which designed many of Columbia University&rsquo,s facilities, designed the building. By the early 1980s, growth in Wharton School programs created a strong need for additional facilities. The University asked the firm of Warner Burns, Toane and Lunde (also from New York) to prepare designs for renovating the original building and for an addition. Behind the new facade, the original Dietrich facade is largely intact on the interior and retains the limestone panel on which was inscribed Dietrich Hall. The addition sides and rear retain the detailing of the original building, which overlaid a slightly orange brick with limestone trim and organized windows into vertical bands in the fashion of contemporary design. The original building honored D. Wellington Dietrich, uncle of H. Richard Dietrich and Daniel W. Dietrich, Wharton graduates and benefactors of the University. The 1983 renovation and addition honors Saul Steinberg, CEO of the Reliance Group Holdings and University graduate, trustee and donor of the facility.",
